					<h1 class="heading">My <span>Dream</span></h1>

					<p>I have only one dream in my life.</p>
					<p> My only dream in my life is become a successful person someday I know all of us wanted to become
                        a successful person but how many people achieve to do it? I don't want just to become a successful
                        person with just a money alone, I wanted to be more than that. I want to change our country where 
                        you can find people with incompetent skills to be part of government, where people who are thief
                        can be more successful than an average people i don't want to drop some name but you know who is the
                        person am talking to. that's my dream to change our country, i saw a person with a potential to change
                        our country but sadly the people on this country are too much blind to see what she can do, all they do 
                        is keep doubting her but here we go facing a economic crisis the prices of foods are going higher and higher.
                        I wanted to chnange it but i know that i can't do it, that's why it is just my silly dream.
